To capture these potential targets, we are  systematically performing WGS and RNAseq profiling across the cell line models. As part of the CCLE project, we performed deeper profiling in subsets of cell lines. \n        <br><br>\n        In the next phase of DepMap, we will be performing additional omics for all cell lines to more comprehensively capture genome alterations.

To date, we have performed genome-wide RNAi and CRISPR loss-of-function screens in more than 1000 cancer cell lines.. \n        <br><br>\n        In parallel, we are employing a multiplexed approach (PRISM) to profile hundreds of cellular models for drug sensitivities. After profiling the  drug repurposing library,we are continuing to profile compounds of interest to create the largest oncology reference dataset to date. \n        <br><br>\n        At the core of our activities, we are building new analytical tools to better capture these genetic dependencies and drug sensitivities. Methods such as DEMETER, DEMETER2, CERES and CHRONOS have helped us better model cancer dependencies and drug sensitivities.  \n          <br><br>\n          In a new phase of the project, we will be expanding to include rare and pediatric cancers and incorporate additional models such as 3D models, mouse models among others. \n\n        </p>\n      </v-col>\n    </v-row>\n\n\n    <v-row class=\"v-spacing\">\n\n      <v-col\n        cols=\"12\"\n        sm=\"4\"\n        md=\"4\"\n        lg=\"3\"\n      >\n      <v-img\n        width=\"100%\"\n        src=\"images/approach-28.png\"\n      >\n      </v-img>\n      </v-col>\n      <v-col\n        cols=\"12\"\n        sm=\"8\"\n        md=\"8\"\n        lg=\"8\"\n      >\n        <h3>Create a map of cancer vulnerabilities</h3>\n        <p>We are building connections with all the datasets to identify relationships between genetic dependencies, drug sensitivities and cellular features.
