To capture these potential targets, we are  systematically performing WGS and RNAseq profiling across the cell line models. As part of the CCLE project, we performed deeper profiling in subsets of cell lines. \n        <br><br>\n        In the next phase of DepMap, we will be performing additional omics for all cell lines to more comprehensively capture genome alterations.
